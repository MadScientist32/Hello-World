# Hello-World
Just another repository.

Hello to anyone who reads this!

My name is Evan Nelson, but here on Github, I go by Madscientist, Madscientist32, or Evanthemadscientist.
I enjoy programming and I am just starting to learn how to use github.
My current programming language of choice would have to be python as it is the one I am most farmilliar with.
But, if you were to ask me what my second favorite language is, I would have to say C++ because I use it most often to write Arduino sketches.
I have a dog named Loki and he is really cute.
I am one of 7 siblings.
That is most all of what you may need to know about me for now.
More details may be added later.
